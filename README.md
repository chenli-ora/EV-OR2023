**Data files** for numerical replication of the paper ``Li Chen, Long He, Yangfang (Helen) Zhou (2023) An Exponential Cone Programming Approach for Managing Electric Vehicle Charging. Operations Research 0(0). https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2023.2460''

- *large arrival rate.p* is the data file containing the calibriated arrival rates in the numerical study of the paper. You can use it to reproduce Table 1 in the paper.
- *EV-SAA.html* illustrates how to use the above data file by solving a sample average approximation (SAA) problem using Python with Mosek fusion API.
- *readme.pdf* includes some details of the SAA problem in the numerical experiments.

We plan to utilize the Python package *rsome* (https://xiongpengnus.github.io/rsome/) to showcase the numerical experiments detailed in the paper. You are welcome take
